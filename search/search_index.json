This project will enable analysis of issues and trends relating to use of these vehicles at a national, regional and local level. The project team will develop and link two data sources focused on the registration and usage patterns of all light duty vehicles (under 3.5 tonnes) in Great Britain, to create a single de-identified, research-ready dataset. By combining this data, the project will create an invaluable resource for researchers to address urgent transport, environmental and social policy questions. Research using this data will have the potential to inform government action on climate change, air quality and health, road safety and taxation.
