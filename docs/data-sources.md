# Data sources

The [project team](/team) will develop and link two data sources focused on the registration and usage patterns of all light duty vehicles (under 3.5 tonnes) in Great Britain, to create a single de-identified, research-ready dataset.

This dataset will be comprised of: 

- **registration data** collected by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), which records vehicle attributes and the location of the registered keeper 

- **MOT data** which includes the make, model, age, engine type and odometer reading of every vehicle taking a road worthiness test in Great Britain
