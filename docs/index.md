We are working to develop novel environmental monitoring hardware capable of being mounted onto electric scooters.

The [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/) has teamed up with [Voi](https://www.voi.com/) and [West of England Combined Authority](https://www.westofengland-ca.gov.uk/) to try to better understand pollution in Bristol. We have designed a pollution sensor integrates with Voi e-scooters, collecting pollution data as the vehicle is ridden around.

To-date, we have produced a proof of concept device and demonstrated that it can be integrated into the scooters. We are now about to deploy 30 prototype units around Bristol using a cohort of volunteer riders.

We hope that in time the data collected will help generate a near-real-time pollution map of Bristol.

Find out more about the project by reading our [frequently asked questions](faq.md).
