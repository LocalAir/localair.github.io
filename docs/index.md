__We are working to develop novel environmental monitoring hardware capable of being mounted onto electric scooters.__

To-date, we have produced a proof of concept device and demonstrated that it can be intergrated into the scooters. We are now about to deploy 30 prototype units around Bristol. We hope that in time the data collected will help generate a near-real-time pollution map of Bristol. 

We are partnering with Voi and the West of England Combined Authority, who are allowing our devices to be fitted onto scooters driven by project volunteers.
