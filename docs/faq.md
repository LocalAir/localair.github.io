# Frequently asked questions

## Why are you doing this?
Clean air is crucial to our health, and accurate and extensive pollution monitoring is essential for an understanding of where pollution is a problem and how effective clean air policies are being. One of the biggest challenges when deploying a pollution sensor network is how to provide power and telecoms to the sensor hardware. 

An ability to integrate sensors into e-scooter hardware provides solutions to both these challenges, meaning that, when implemented at scale, this approach will enable data collection in locations that would otherwise be completely impractical. By the end of this 30-unit trial we will have demonstrated the effectiveness of deploying sensors in this way, while also understanding any limitations and identifying (and overcoming) any hurdles that might hamper a successful deployment at a larger scale.  

## How will this be done?
Sensors will be mounted onto _long term rental_ scooters, which are only used by a single individual. These individuals will be recruited for participation in the project. Once recruited, their scooters will be fitted with our custom environmental monitoring hardware.

## What is in it for the participants?
Participants in the project will have access to the data gathered by their enviromental sensor, giving them a unique view of their own pollution exposure. This will help them to make informed choices around which routes to take through the city.
